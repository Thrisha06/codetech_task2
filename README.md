🏠 IoT Home Automation using Arduino
This project is a simple Home Automation system built using an Arduino-compatible board. It lets you control a light and a fan using serial commands like LIGHT_ON, FAN_OFF, etc.

🚀 Getting Started
Tested on: Arduino Uno, NodeMCU ESP8266 (using Serial passthrough)

✅ Hardware Required
Arduino Uno or NodeMCU (ESP8266/ESP32 with UART passthrough)
1x LED (or light bulb with relay)
1x Fan (DC or via relay)
2x 220Ω resistors (if using LED)
Breadboard, USB cable, jumper wires
